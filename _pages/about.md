naive, yet even curious
   




2024:   
I’m a 5th-year Ph.D. student in Cognition and Neural Systems at the University of Arizona’s Psychology Department. My research primarily focuses on memory updating. I am currently actively seeking a position. 

If you happen upon any opportunities or insights, I'd sincerely appreciate hearing from you at mmpeng@arizona.edu.
